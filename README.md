# Mixed-Graphical-Models

Review of exponential family graphical models + code for parameter estimation for the Gaussian-Potts mixed graphical model.

The report is the final draft and the slides were used for a brief presentation. Note that the slides served as a first draft for most of the equations so there are a few minor errors.
Please refer to the survey! 

I am currently implimenting the perscribed parameter estimation scheme (Lee and Hastie 2014) and will push my work soon.
